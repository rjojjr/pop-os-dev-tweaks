# Pop OS Dev Tweaks

This repo is meant to be a collection of tweaks/scripts that 
make development work on Pop OS easier.

I was working with a fresh install of Pop OS 22.04
with Nvidia drivers on a Lenovo Legion laptop when
I created this repo. Some of the scripts included 
may need to be tweaked.

Please give this repo a star if you find anything contained 
herein useful.

## Other OSes

Although the modules in this repo target Pop OS, they
should probably work on just about any Debian Linux distro,
although some tweaking may be required.

## Modules
