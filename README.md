# Pop OS Dev Tweaks

This repo is meant to be a collection of tweaks/scripts that 
make development work on Pop OS easier.

I was working with a fresh install of Pop OS 22.04
with Nvidia drivers on a Lenovo Legion laptop when
I created this repo. Some of the scripts included 
may need to be tweaked.
